### Description

My first assignment using JavaScript.

Using the onclick() functionality of HTML, the grid system of Bootstrap, and JavaScript, I created an application which allows the user to run two functions : one to generate a password, and one to copy the password to clipboard.  For the generated password, the user is prompted some parameters for the password: length and character type.

In my program, I used nested Arrays, but upon reflection I realized Objects would have functioned better if this were a collaborative project.

### Concepts

##### Loops

    ..* For loops and while loops allowed me to iterate through the same functionality based on conditions.

##### If/Else Statements

    ..* If/Else statements allows me to run code based on conditions.

##### Functions

    ..* Functions allow us to create modules of code which can be reused throughout the program.  Functions also help with organization and efficency from a UX perspective.

##### HTML and JavaScript communication
